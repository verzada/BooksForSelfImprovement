# BooksForSelfImprovement
Books that can or might change your view.

## Why
We can either try to do our own thing or begin with learning from others before we do our own thing.

## Method of reading:
Got time - buy the books
Got no time - buy the audio book or subscribe at audible or similar services. Listen on the go.

## Where to start
If you argue a lot - Dale Carnegie
If you are an introvert - Dale Carnegie then Susan Cain
If you are an introvert that also does management - the above plus Kim Scott and Gene Kim

## I've read or reading so far:

### How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie
The first book I read that made me look at people differently. Though the title makes the book sound like a tool to manipulate people, it's rather a tool to make you see people from a different angle.

### The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain
Why being an introvert is a strenght instead of a weakness. 

### The Phoenix Project and / or The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim
See the madness that occurs when development is done top down and driven by people who has no ownership of the final product.

### Radical Candor by Kim Scott 
A slightly different angle than "How To Win Friends and Influence People"?

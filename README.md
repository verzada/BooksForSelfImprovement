# Books for self improvement
Books that can or might change your view.
Each of us, up till now, has been influenced either by people or experiences, with or without a guide to help us through handling either the people or experiences.

If you master most situations, then congratulations, that is really rare. 
For the rest of us, I'd recommend reading a few books.

Don't confuse the lists of books in this repository, with self help books such as "The secret".
These books are based on the authors experiences, experiences they try to convey in either through fiction, anecdotes and/or principles.

## Why
We can either try to do our own thing from scratch, or we can learn from those who has spent decades figuring out the same thing we're about to try out ourselves.
Education today (per 2020), at least in Norway, does not teach peopleskills nor emotionalskills that lets you handle life in the best possible way. These skills are either learned by experience (if you are lucky) or by reading (if you are lucky enough to be made aware). 

The hardest thing about the list of books, is to actually apply the change to yourself. Especially if you are like me; got lots of bad habits and need to really struggle to incorporate change.

Questions to ask yourself after reading the books:
- Has the book changed how you speak to people? 
- Has the book changed how you handle people?
- Has the book changed how to handle yourself?
- Has the book made you aware of why you are feeling as you do?

## What to achieve
- Less annoyed with the world
- Contribute more
- See the world for what it is
- Stop trying to fix other people
- Be the change
- Feel the change
- Be less of a cog in a machinery
- Know (and really feel) it is never about you

## Method of reading:

- Got time - buy the books
- Got no time - buy the audio book or subscribe at Audible or similar services. Listen on the go.

## Where to start
- If you argue a lot - Dale Carnegie
- If you are an introvert - Dale Carnegie then Susan Cain
- If you are an introvert that also does IT management - the above plus Kim Scott and Gene Kim

These are the books that gave me at least, a sense of which type of books I should read next.

## I've read or reading so far:

### How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie
The first book I read, that made me look at people differently. Though the title makes the book sound like a tool to manipulate people, it's rather a tool to make you see people from a different angle.

### The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain
Why being an introvert is a strength instead of a weakness. 

### The Phoenix Project and / or The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim
See the madness that occurs when development is done top down and driven by people who has no ownership of the final product. Why you are important, and why seeing the full state of a project, is more important than following procedure.

### Radical Candor by Kim Scott 
A slightly different angle than "How To Win Friends and Influence People"?
